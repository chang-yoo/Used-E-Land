# Used-E-Land
A web applicaton for users who want to sell their used items or buy others.

Would you rather keep stuffs that are just left in the house/not being used forever or sell them at a lower price for profit? I recently realized taht there are a lot of items that I don't use anymore but in very good condition. So, I was thinking if I could create an application where it's very simple to upload and easy for users to interact. Used-Ecommerce-land not only lets users to get their wanted items at a lower price but also helps seller to make profits.
